    <h2>THE FOUNDERS</h2>
    <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee Donahoe,
      and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical sophistication taught by
      the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit at least a billion people, and probably
      more.
